Using historical New York City Uber pickup data from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission and hourly weather data from the National Weather Service Forecast Office I designed a Shiny app for New York City rideshare drivers that recommends a destination at which they will likely find passengers faster. The recommendation is based on the user's current location, time, day of the week and the temperature in NYC.

Here is a blog post I wrote about the project and results: https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/uber-optimization-finding-passengers-faster/

The data is a free data set available on FiveThirtyEight's Github: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response
